## [6.0.0] – 2025-11-15

## Midnight Beta – Addon Status

Because of Blizzard’s new addon API restrictions in **Midnight**, some EQoL features have to behave differently in combat than before.  
Here’s what currently works, what’s limited, and what’s turned off in the Midnight beta.

### ✨ Added

- Dungeon teleports and talent reminder for midnight dungeon
- **Visibility Hub** (UI → Action Bar) lets you pick any Blizzard action bar or frame, then mix-and-match mouseover, combat, and the new “Player health below 100%” triggers with a single dropdown workflow. Action bars still expose their anchor/keybind extras when selected.
- Action bars gained a dedicated “While skyriding” visibility rule so you can force a bar (e.g., Action Bar 1) to appear when using Skyriding/Dragonriding abilities.
- Legion Remix achievements can now list their reward items directly in the missing-items tooltip, complete with item-quality coloring.
- Resource Bars can now anchor to the Essential/Utility cooldown viewers, both buff trackers, and all default Blizzard action bars (Main + MultiBars) for tighter layouts without custom macros.
- Health bars gained a “Use class color” toggle alongside the existing custom-color controls so you can instantly match your class tint without extra configuration.
- Resource Bars now have an optional “Hide out of combat” toggle that drives the frame visibility via a secure state driver, so the bars stay hidden without tripping combat lockdown.
- Adjust the columns per row in **Button Sink**

### 🔄 Changed

- **Aura Tracker**
  - In **combat**, almost all auras are now “hidden” from addons by Blizzard.  
    → Practically **no auras can be iterated in combat** anymore.  
    → Aura checks and updates happen **after combat**, when the restrictions are lifted.
  - **Out of combat**, new auras are scanned and displayed as usual.
  - **Resource bars**
    - Fully **Midnight-compatible**.
- Unit frame visibility now uses the same scenario model as action bars, enabling multiple states per frame while keeping legacy “always hide” support.
- Health-triggered frame fades only register the relevant unit events when a frame actually uses that rule, and updates are throttled to avoid `UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT` spam.

### ⏰ Temporarily disabled

These features are turned off **only for the Midnight beta** until there’s a safe way to re-implement them:

- **Tooltip enhancements**
  - Actually all stuff doing anything like adding data to the tooltip is disabled, as of a bug in midnight beta
- **Buff hiding on raid frames** in Midnight beta (disabled until a working solution is found)
- **Vendor module** tooltip information
- Changing the **max color** for power/resource bars
- The **“Smooth bars”** option is temporarily disabled. Blizzard is adding a built-in smoothing feature, which EQoL will use once it’s available.
- Account money frame feature (due to tooltip-handling bugs)

### ❌ Removed (Midnight beta)

These features are currently removed in the Midnight beta because of API changes or bugs:

- **Inventory**
  - Cloak Upgrade button (Midnight beta only)
- **Module:** `CombatMeter`
- **Mythic+ features**
  - Auto-marking tank and healer (now requires hardware events / secure input)
  - Potion tracker
- **Aura-based features**
  - Cast tracker
  - Cooldown notify

### 💡 Side note

- The **trinket cooldown tracking** inside **_Aura Tracker_** still works.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Nameplate **health percentage / absolute values** corrected for Midnight beta
- Tooltip error when hovering items with the **ignore list** enabled
- Player frame now correctly shown at **100% health** in Midnight beta
- Boss frames are now **targetable** again when changing visibility behaviour
- Error when hovering the **EQoL options menu** fixed
- Removed `UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT` (API is deprecated)
- Context menu checks for **NPC ID** hardened to avoid errors
- Health macro combat checks moved into **protected** logic
- **Healthbar colors** no longer sometimes display the wrong color
- Keybind shortening leads to invisible text
