## [7.19.1] - 2026-02-18

- Unit Frames (Auras): Fixed a secret-value/taint Lua error in aura border color fallback handling (`canActivePlayerDispel`) during aura updates.

---

## [7.17.1] - 2026-02-16

- Group Frames: Border offset now expands the border outward, so increasing it no longer makes the actual frame content area smaller.
